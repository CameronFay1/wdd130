        <h2>Utah</h2>
        <img src="images/utah-flag.webp" alt="utah flag">
        <p>Utah is a landlocked state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States.
            It is
            one of the Four Corners states, sharing a border with Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico.
            It also
            borders Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, and Nevada to the west. In
            comparison to all
            the U.S. states and territories, Utah, with a population of just over three million, is
            the
            13th-largest by area, the 30th-most populous, and the 11th-least densely populated.
            Urban
            development is mostly concentrated in two regions: the Wasatch Front in the
            north-central part of
            the state, which includes the state capital, Salt Lake City, and is home to roughly
            two-thirds of
            the population; and Washington County in the southwest, which has approximately 180,000
            residents. Most of the western half of Utah lies in the Great Basin.</p>
